# Winger

Inspired by the Finger utility of yesteryear, Winger is a command-line program for Windows which prints out information for an active directory user.

The program takes a single argument - the username of the person you want to look up.

Before using Winger, you must set the ActiveDirectoryRoot in the config file. If you don't know what this is, a first guess might be gc://yourcompany.com (of course, replacing yourcompany with the appropriate value).
